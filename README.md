# Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains scripts for performing sentiment analysis using two different models: NLTK and Transformers.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze sentiments in text data. We use two different models for this purpose:

1. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.

2. **Transformers**: A state-of-the-art machine learning model from Hugging Face, known for its effectiveness in NLP tasks.

## Features

- **Model Comparison**: A script is included that allows for a side-by-side comparison of the performance of the two models.

- **Clipboard Analysis**: Another script utilizes the `pyperclip` library to analyze text data that has been copied to the clipboard.

We hope you find this repository useful for your sentiment analysis tasks. Feel free to contribute and enhance its capabilities.
